        "Welcome to the practice notebook on ensemble methods! This notebook will guide you through the process of using ensemble techniques to predict customer churn. The dataset consists of various features related to bank customers, and your goal is to build predictive models to determine whether a customer will churn. Here is a brief explanation of the dataset's columns:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`customer_id`**: A unique identifier for each customer.\n",
        "- **`credit_score`**: The customer's credit score.\n",

        "- **`gender`**: The customer's gender.\n",
        "- **`age`**: The customer's age.\n",
        "- **`tenure`**: The number of years the customer has been with the bank.\n",
        "- **`balance`**: The customer's account balance.\n",
        "- **`products_number`**: The number of bank products the customer uses.\n",
        "- **`credit_card`**: Indicates whether the customer has a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No).\n",
        "- **`active_member`**: Indicates whether the customer is an active member (1 = Yes, 0 = No).\n",
        "- **`estimated_salary`**: The customer's estimated annual salary.\n",
        "- **`churn`**: The target variable, indicating whether the customer has churned (1 = Yes, 0 = No).\n",
        "\n",
        "As you work through the notebook, you will load the data, preprocess it, and apply various ensemble methods such as Random Forest to predict the churn status. Remember to evaluate the performance of your models using appropriate metrics. Enjoy your practice and aim to identify the most effective ensemble technique for this problem!\n",
